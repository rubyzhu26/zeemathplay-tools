🔮 Magic Kaleidoscope Maker
Mathematics in Motion, Art by Logic.

A high-performance, interactive web tool that transforms mathematical parameters into stunning, symmetrical visual art. Created to explore the beauty of geometry and generative design.

🌟 Key Features
Mathematical Precision: Real-time rendering of geometric patterns using 极坐标变换 (Polar Coordinate Transformations) with adjustable symmetry (4–16 axes).

Layered Complexity: Control visual depth through multiple Layers and Complexity sliders to simulate a physical kaleidoscope's refraction.

Dynamic Visual Styles:

6 Geometric Patterns: Petal, Star, Circle, Diamond, Triangle, and Spiral.

Curated Palettes: Including "Cotton Candy," "Galaxy Dream," and more.

Studio-Grade Output: One-click HD PNG Export (1200x1200px) for professional use or educational materials.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Core: Pure JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas API for 60FPS smooth animation.

UI/UX: Responsive CSS with Google Fonts (Baloo 2 & Nunito) for a modern, playful interface.


Logic: Multimodal-friendly design, easily adaptable for future AI-driven visual auditing.

📖 How to Use
Interact: Use the control panel to modify symmetry, layers, and pattern styles.

Generate: Click "New Pattern" to reset the rotation and explore new logic.

Save: Use "Save My Art" to download your high-resolution masterpiece.
